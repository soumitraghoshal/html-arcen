<h5>EDUCATION</h5>
Progress is not possible without education; <br \>
along with eradication of poverty education accelerates <br \>
the country's social and economic development.<br \>

Little Misty was not poor because the dreams she used to see, <br \>
dreams of going into space, dreams of flying aeroplanes, <br \>
dreams of becoming a scientist because her father got her admission in school, <br \>
the expansion of her dreams was infinite, she wanted to become a news reader.<br \>
Now she has stopped dreaming, after losing her father in an accident, <br \>
the responsibilities have suddenly come on her head. Now she also goes to work with her mother. <br \>
Her future dreams are now lost somewhere.<br \>

Because parents' own level of education and financial uncertainty at the unit level affects the lives of their children. <br \>
Because of this, 16 million children like Misty become child labourers. <br \>
Arcenciel Foundation as an NGO runs the mission "Satrangi Education" to help thousands of <br \>
poor children like Misty and make their dreams come true. <br \>
In which such children are given an opportunity to study and move forward, <br \>
whose studies are left in the middle due to some reasons.<br \><br \>


You can choose the online medium of Arcenciel Foundation for donation to educate a poor child.<br \>
It gifts you that child's life-changing benefit for recurring monthly and annual contributions.<br \>
.
Your online donation will ensure that the child receives education, <br \>
health care as well as nutritional support through every stage of their young life.<br \>

<h4>SKILL DEVLOPMENT</h4>
India  is one of the fastest growing economies of the world with a large youth population. <br \>
To sustain this growth, industries in India have a constant demand for skilled youth<br \>

But due to poverty in India, most of the youth mainly in rural areas are dropped out of the <br \>
theoretical educational system and due to inadequate infrastructure for industry related skills, <br \>
millions of youths become unemployable.<br \>

Making youth skilled and connecting them with employment has become an essential task..<br \>
Since right skill can give right employment to the youth, <br \>
therefore the focus of Arcenciell Foundation is to develop right skills in <br \>
contemporary situation and to make youth skilled for employment through practical <br \>
training "working with hands" and "learning by doing".<br \><br \>
Arcenciel Foundation has been imparting skill training to rural women and youth <br \>
since last years so that the problem of their livelihood does not arise under any circumstances.<br \>
Apart from government schemes, these skill development programs are <br \>
operated with the assistance received from CSR and donors, <br \>
which is helpful in fighting the problem of unemployment.<br \><br \>

<h4>DISASTER MANAGMENT</h4>
Disaster risks in India are further exacerbated by changing demographic, <br \>
socio-economic conditions – unplanned urbanization, development within high-risk zones, <br \>
environmental degradation, climate change, and growing vulnerabilities related to epidemics <br \>

cause catastrophic loss to life and property. All these factors add up to a situation where <br \>
disasters seriously endanger the sustainable development of the country, <br \>
apart from innumerable lives and livelihoods.<br \>

relief like safe drinking water, medical aid, health camps and supply of daily essentials <br \>

needs of disaster-affected people, while also maintaining a sustainable approach to helping <br \>
them rebuild their lives by facilitating their education, healthcare and livelihoods Is.<br \>
