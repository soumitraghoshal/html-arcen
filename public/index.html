    <h4>EDUCATION</h4>
    Progress is not possible without education; <br \>
    along with eradication of poverty education accelerates <br \>
    the country's social and economic development.<br \>
    
    Little Misty was not poor because the dreams she used to see, <br \>
    dreams of going into space, dreams of flying aeroplanes, <br \>
    dreams of becoming a scientist because her father got her admission in school, <br \>
    the expansion of her dreams was infinite, she wanted to become a news reader.<br \>
    Now she has stopped dreaming, after losing her father in an accident, <br \>
    the responsibilities have suddenly come on her head. Now she also goes to work with her mother. <br \>
    Her future dreams are now lost somewhere.<br \>
    <img src="../assets/images/girls_1.jpeg" height="1000" alt="class room image" \><br \>
    Because parents' own level of education and financial uncertainty at the unit level affects the lives of their children. <br \>
    Because of this, 16 million children like Misty become child labourers. <br \>
    Arcenciel Foundation as an NGO runs the mission "Satrangi Education" to help thousands of <br \>
    poor children like Misty and make their dreams come true. <br \>
    In which such children are given an opportunity to study and move forward, <br \>
    whose studies are left in the middle due to some reasons.<br \><br \>
    
    
    You can choose the online medium of Arcenciel Foundation for donation to educate a poor child.<br \>
    It gifts you that child's life-changing benefit for recurring monthly and annual contributions.<br \>
    
    Your online donation will ensure that the child receives education, <br \>
    health care as well as nutritional support through every stage of their young life.<br \>
    <hr color="blue" \>
    
    <h4>SKILL DEVLOPMENT</h4>
    India  is one of the fastest growing economies of the world with a large youth population. <br \>
    To sustain this growth, industries in India have a constant demand for skilled youth<br \>
    
    But due to poverty in India, most of the youth mainly in rural areas are dropped out of the <br \>
    theoretical educational system and due to inadequate infrastructure for industry related skills, <br \>
    millions of youths become unemployable.<br \>
    
    Making youth skilled and connecting them with employment has become an essential task..<br \>
    Since right skill can give right employment to the youth, <br \>
    therefore the focus of Arcenciell Foundation is to develop right skills in <br \>
    contemporary situation and to make youth skilled for employment through practical <br \>
    training "working with hands" and "learning by doing".<br \><br \>
    Arcenciel Foundation has been imparting skill training to rural women and youth <br \>
    since last years so that the problem of their livelihood does not arise under any circumstances.<br \>
    Apart from government schemes, these skill development programs are <br \>
    operated with the assistance received from CSR and donors, <br \>
    which is helpful in fighting the problem of unemployment.<br \><br \>

    <h4>DISASTER MANAGMENT</h4>
    Disaster risks in India are further exacerbated by changing demographic, <br \>
    socio-economic conditions – unplanned urbanization, development within high-risk zones, <br \>
    environmental degradation, climate change, and growing vulnerabilities related to epidemics <br \>
    and pandemics. Earthquakes, cyclones, tsunamis, floods, landslides and forest fires can <br \>
    cause catastrophic loss to life and property. All these factors add up to a situation where <br \>
    disasters seriously endanger the sustainable development of the country, <br \>
    apart from innumerable lives and livelihoods.<br \>
    <img src="../assets/images/baddh_2.png" height="1000" alt="image" \><br \>

    needs of disaster-affected people, while also maintaining a sustainable approach to helping <br \>
    them rebuild their lives by facilitating their education, healthcare and livelihoods Is.<br \>
    <hr color="blue" \>
    <h4>CAMPAIGNS</h4>
    The root cause of the problems is lack of awareness. <br \>
    Any problem can be solved through awareness in the society.<br \>
    Various awareness campaigns have been successfully organized by <br \>
    Arcenciel Foundation with the help of people in the society. <br \>
